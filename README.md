## About me
I am a programmer.

For programming you need: A text editor and a compiler. 

Anything aside from that is not programming and I hate it because it prevents me from doing actual programming.

## Things I hate.

When tools are slow. And riddled with bugs. And *slow*. And made by Microsoft. And SLOW. 

Beurocracy.

## Things that are kinda dumb

Object oriented programming

Web development

## Things I like
Complaining.

When something is a one time payment and then I actually own it.

When tools do one thing and they do it well.

Brutal honesty.
