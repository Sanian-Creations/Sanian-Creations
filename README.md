#### Rule 1: All software sucks
#### Rule 2: If the software doesn't suck, Rule 1 applies
#### Rule 3: Object oriented software sucks a little more than everything else

## About me
I am a programmer. For programming you need: A text editor and a compiler. Anything aside from that is not programming and I hate it because it prevents me from doing actual programming.

### Stuff that sucks
* Software that's:
  * Slow
  * Bug-ridden
  * Made by Microsoft
  * Slow and bug-ridden because it is made by Microsoft
* Beurocracy 
* OOP
* Web dev
* Subscription models

### Stuff that doesn't suck as much
* Complaining. I like it.
* One-time payments. Can we go back to those?
* Honesty. Just say it like it is.
* Software that does one thing, does it well, and nothing else. It doesn't bother me with subscriptions, mandatory accounts, long startup time, pop-ups, pointless animations, nested windows of settings, required internet access for unrelated tasks... Actually, can we put all of that on the list of stuff that sucks?
